# UI/UX Suggestions – Perplexity AI

Hi Team,

I’ve compiled all observations and suggestions related to the UI and UX of Perplexity AI.  

Please check out the detailed suggestions here: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8yHLrW8Mc9S9Ie9Zob8V1JEI7-GfYGS5cplid337CI/edit?usp=sharing).  

I’d be happy to help implement these improvements and contribute to enhancing the platform.

Thanks!
